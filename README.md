# Travelling Salesman Simulation

<!-- ## Definition -->

**The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the problem of finding the shortest path that visits a set of customers and returns to the first. It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.**

# DescriptionðŸ§ 
This project includes simulation of TSP using three methods:
1. Brute Force Approach
2. Dynamic Programming Approach
3. Genetic Algorithm Approach

Three buttons will be provided to the user on the home page along with a drop down option to select number of cities for which program will be simulating the algorithm.

After that you will be directed to a page where you will be providing the coordinates for all the cities. There is also a button provided there if you want to initialise with random positions.
